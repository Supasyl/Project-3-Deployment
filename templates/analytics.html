                <h3>Core message & Motivation</h3>
                <p>Addiction and mental health are still taboo subjects in Australia. I hope to make it more approachable and up for discussion by bringing it to people’s attention.
                    Even though alcohol is not considered an illegal substance, it has a big impact on Australians. It is part of the culture and socialising. I hope to provide more openness about what addiction is including alcoholism.<br> 
                    I thought it would be interesting to find out how much of our demographics is the cause for an addiction or mental health disorder.<br>
                    To get people involved in the subject, it is not enough to just talk about it. There is plenty of easily available information out there, it is the ability to recognise it and the will to take time out of your life to check it out. And most people are too busy to realise it or are in denial. It is easier not to accept it, than to confront it.<br>
                    (Most) People love talking about themselves, so I wanted to make this a proper interaction. What better way than to provide a short survey and make a prediction on their substance use and mental health state. 
                    This way, it will be an easier topic to talk about. Like, “have you seen that website with these (accurate or ridiculous, etc) predictions about me?”<br>
                    These are the predictions I want to provide:

                <p>Searching for data was easy. Finding publicly available data was not. 
                    In Australia the only information about health that is publicly available is statistical information. Since I needed the raw data to apply machine learning, I could not use this. Fortunately, in the US they are not as protective of their health data. The limitation is that the machine learning is based on behaviour of people in the US. In Australia, we may, or may not, behave the same way.<br>
                    The data I found is a very long survey (about 2,000 questions), the ‘National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)’. This survey has been taken since 1979. I have used 2015 to 2019 as the basis for the machine learning. The raw datasets have over 56,000 rows of data with over 2,500 categories for each year which totals at over 280,000 rows.<br>

                <p>It is important to find a balance between getting a prediction of 100% accuracy and the information required to achieve that result. Especially since I want people to do the survey and talk about it amongst family and friends. It is no use if people look at the survey and click away because it is way too long.<br>
                    To get an idea on how much data I needed for the machine learning models to be as accurate as possible without needing the life history of the person completing my survey, I started with all the categories and worked my way down.

                        The initial prediction is based on all 63 categories with category 64 as the y-value.

                        The second prediction is based on all demographic categories and the selected categories related to the prediction.

                        The fourth prediction is based on the most important demographic categories and the single most important related category. I added this prediction because initially doing the prediction with only the demographic information was not very accurate. As I was still in the initial phase I didn't save my result as I should have. Since I am adding categories I will also check if some categories have a very low impact on the prediction so I can maby remove some of them to balance out the amount of questions in the survey.

                <p>This dataset already came with binary encoding. Because the fitting of the data to the model didn’t work as it was too large, I realised I had to encode the data further. Some binary codes were in the 90’s or even 900’s. An example is 85 and 985 represent bad data. Once this was completed, there was no more issue.<br>
                    This project has a timeframe of 2 weeks. I had to manage my time well and didn’t have time to run all models considering the number of models required for this project. I chose to start with the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.<br>
                    It did take 1h20 to complete the fitting and predication of the largest dataset to both models including using the parameter optimiser GridSearchCV.

                <h3 class='under text-center'>Logistic Regression model</h3>
                <p>I chose to start with the logistic regression because it is the benchmark model. It is the most common model as the logic behind it is explained more easily than the other available models. It uses an equation (logarithmic transformation) on the outcome variable which allows us to model a non-linear association in a linear way. The key values are binary values rather than a numeric value. The binary value represents a categorical outcome. An example is a question with a yes or no response. These values will be represented as 0 and 1 to calculate the probability of each outcome based on other variables.

                <h3 class='under text-center'>Random Forest model</h3>
                <p>As my dataset consists of a lot of classifications, it is important to know which ones contribute most to the prediction. This is important because even tough people want to talk about themselves and be involved, they don’t want to spend hours answering questions. This is why I chose the Random Forest model as the second model to ensure I can ask the least number of questions to get the most accurate prediction.</p>

                <p> This is to accurately predict the estimated number of days that the subject will smoke cigarettes in the next 30 days.<br><br>
                    <i>Initial prediction</i><br>
                    The initial prediction based on the 63 categories is almost 100% (0.999) for both models and there is no difference if the classifications have been optimised or not.<br><br>
                    <i>Second prediction</i><br>
                    The second prediction based on 20 categories is just as accurate at almost 100% (0.999) for both models and again there is no difference if the classifications have been optimised or not.<br>
                    The category that influences the prediction the most is ‘CIG100LF’, which is if they have smoked 100 cigarettes in their life. This category will be added to the questions to the subject. As such I will also use it in the predications of the models for the other predications (alcohol, drug and mental health).<br><br>
                    <i>Third prediction</i><br>
                    The accuracy of the third prediction based on 16 categories is a lot less. This is to be expected as there is no information about any smoking habit from the subject.<br>
                    The initial R2 value in the Logistic Regression model is 0.601 for the training data and 0.596 for the test data. The exact same score is achieved after optimising the classifications. The values are very close, so the model is successful.<br>
                    The outcome of the prediction of the Random Forest model is not as good as the Logistic regression model. The R2 for the training data is 0.796 but the R2 for the test data is 0.578 which is not very close together. This means the prediction is not going to be very accurate. After optimising the parameters, the outcome is nearly the same as the initial model.<br><br>
                    The demographic categories that had the least amount of influence on the predication (&lt;0.02) and may be removed depending on the outcome of the other predications are:<br>

                <p>This is to accurately predict the estimated number of days that the subject will drink an alcoholic beverage in the next 30 days.<br><br>
                    For the smoking predication there was a question in the survey about estimated smokes per 30 days using groups. This option is also available for drinks but more than 50% skipped the question making the dataset significantly smaller. That is why I decided not to use the same category.<br><br>
                    <i>Initial prediction</i><br>
                    As expected, due to the number of available options (30), the prediction value is quite low at approximately 0.54. I didn’t expect it to be this low though due to still having 4 other alcohol related categories.<br><br> 
                    The random Forest model has a very high R2 value for the training data but the same low value for the test data. This indicates that the model is not working well.<br>
                    <i>Second prediction</i><br>
                    The second prediction has almost the same values as the first prediction, including the high difference in training and test data by Random Forest.<br><br>
                    The category that influences the prediction the most is ‘ALCUS30D, which is the number of alcoholic drinks each day that you had a drink in the last 30 days. This category will be added to the questions to the subject. As such I will also use it in the predications of the models for the other predications (drug and mental health).<br><br>
                    <i>Third prediction</i><br>
                    As expected, the Logistic regression prediction value is even less at 0.37. The Random Forest predication for the training data is significantly more than the test data which we have seen before for this model.<br><br>
                    The feature importance is showing that there are 7 categories under 0.02. To keep it consistent with the predication for smoking, the bottom 4 categories are:

                <p> This is to accurately predict how likely it is that the subject will use any of these substances in their lifetime.<br><br>
                    Before predicting the likelihood of substance use, I changed the dataframe slightly. I had to summarise some of the substance categories into one category as they were of the same type of substance (hallucinogens (10 types) and inhalants (13 types)).<br><br>
                    <i>Initial prediction</i><br>
                    As there are so many substances to make predictions for, I am using an excerpt for the proof-of-concept prediction. I’m using one of the groups and two other substances. That way I can see if the prediction is consistent or totally different. I have randomly chosen to start with Marijuana, Cocaine and Inhalants.<br><br>
                    In all 3 predictions the category ‘CIGTRY’, which is the age when they first smoked a cigarette, is in the top 2 of feature importance. I will add this category to the questions of the survey, and it will be added to the mental health prediction.<br><br>
                    <i>Second prediction</i><br>
                    The predictions for the 3 drug types vary by about 20%. For two of the drug types the difference of the prediction between the first and second dataset is negligible. For one drug type the difference is quite significant from a 100% accuracy to a 72% accuracy.<br><br>
                    The feature importance is almost identical for all 3 drug types. I will use these predictions without running all the drug types.<br><br>
                    For cocaine and marijuana these are the bottom 4 categories:

                <p>This is to accurately predict how likely it is that the subject has a probable serious mental illness.<br><br>
                    Before predicting the likely mental illness, I calculated the total of the 6 mental health category outcomes in order to predict the final total result.
                    While creating the new category I already encoded the outcome as a binary code of 0 and 1, so there is no need to encode these values any further.<br><br>
                    <i>Initial prediction</i><br>
                    The prediction value for the Logistic Regression is very high at just above 0.92.<br>
                    The Random Forest predication again has some difference between the training and test data. Not as much though staying within 0.1.<br><br>
                    The category that influences the prediction the most is ‘ALCYRTOT, which is the total number of days alcohol was used in the past 12 months. I am not adding this category to the questions as it is a big guess for a quick survey.<br><br>
                    <i>Second prediction</i><br>
                    As there are no other mental health categories, this prediction is similar to the third prediction of the smoking and alcohol predictions. The prediction is performed on all demographic categories with the addition of the most important smoking and alcohol categories.<br>
                    The outcome of this prediction is almost as high as the initial prediction at 0.92 for the training data and 0.919 for the test data. This also indicates that the accuracy is not really affected by the lack of the category that most influences the outcome in the first prediction.<br><br>
                    The demographic categories that had the least amount of influence on the predication (&lt;0.02) and may be removed depending on the outcome of the other predications are:

                <p>As you can see in the table below, the second prediction was skipped for the mental health and substances (drugs) categories. This was done because there are no additional related categories. The prediction would have been the same as the third predication.</p>

                <p>In Australia the only information about health that is publicly available are statistics. Since I need the raw data to apply machine learning, I could not use this. Fortunately, in the USA they are not as protective of their health data. The limitation is that the machine learning is based on behaviour of people in the USA. In Australia, we may, or may not, behave the same. 
                    I have provided a pie-chart of all categories on the Data page, to have the options of investigating the influences of the responses on the predications, if desirable.

                        As the alcohol category scores really low due to the number of optional outcomes, I would have liked to see if the accuracy of the alcohol predictions would have improved using the similar question as I did for smoking with an answer using groups (bins) for alcohol usage in the past 30 days. It will be interesting to see how the models behave differently by significantly reducing the training data.

                        It will be interesting to run the models with different categories to see how the outcome changes.

                        I would have liked to have investigated the impact of substance abuse on mental health further.
